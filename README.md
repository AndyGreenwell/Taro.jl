# Taro

Taro is an utility belt of functions to work with document files in Julia. It uses Apache Tika and Apache POI (via JavaCall) to process the files. Current functionality includes the ability to extract text and metadata from a wide variety of document formats. Coming soon is the ability to read a DataFrame off an Excel sheet.
